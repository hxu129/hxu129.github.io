I am a second-year undergraduate at [HKUST(GZ)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/), majoring in Data Science. I'm currently a member of DIÂ² Lab working with my memtor [Zhangyi HU](https://whu-hzy.github.io/) and Prof. [Yutao YUE](https://facultyprofiles.hkust-gz.edu.cn/faculty-personal-page/YUE-Yutao/yutaoyue). My current research interest involves **time series forcasting** and **reinforcement learning**.

In the future, I wish I could have the chance to **decode the mechanism inside LLMs**, interpreting both **human and machine congnition**.
