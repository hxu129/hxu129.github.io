I am a BSc student in Data Science and Big Data Technology at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), with a GPA of 3.979/4.300 (Rank: 1/137) and on the Dean's List for three semesters.

My research interest includes the intersection between neuroscience and machine learning, with a focus on understanding human perception and recognition. I am currently working on a project for Irregular Multivariate Time Series Prediction using Visual Foundation Models.

I am seeking a challenging yet meaningful opportunity to contribute to further understanding human perception and recognition, as I prepare for future PhD studies in relevant fields.
