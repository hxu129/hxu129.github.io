[**Project**](https://github.com)
- This project addresses irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) prediction challenges with unaligned signals and massive missing values by leveraging visual pretrained masked autoencoders, converting sparse data into time √ó channel image-like patches.
- As a core contributor, I engaged in discussions to use self-supervised learning strategy for data efficient training, designed and executed the majority of experiments, and co-authored the Introduction, Experiment and Conclusion sections of the paper.
